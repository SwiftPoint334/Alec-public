# Alec-public

**Hey there!** Alec is a multi-purpose Discord bot, Alec is fairly new bot and isn't used in any large servers yet, just by adding Alec you're helping our project!


# Self Hosting

**Alec** is open source mainly to get help from the community, we don't have any official documentation on how to self-host Alec, but here's a rough guide;

1. Clone Alec's repo to where you want to host the bot.
```
git clone https://github.com/SwiftPoint334/Alec-public.git
```
2. Install the packages required;
```
Discord.py - python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
Dotenv - pip install python-dotenv
Discord.py slash - pip install discord-py-slash-command
```
3. Make a file called `.env` inside the folder, add your token like so:
```
DISCORD_BOT_SECRET=jfhgdfjvhdskjafgds6er545.5467trghefv
                   ^                                  ^
                        You'd put your token here.
```
4. Run it! `python3 main.py`
